# Cardano Treasury Monitor Agent - Research Documentation Index

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive research documentation for the Cardano Treasury Monitor Agent, organized in a logical workflow from market analysis to implementation.

## Document Structure

### 01-MARKET_LANDSCAPE_AND_TOOLS.md
**Purpose**: Analyze the current Cardano treasury monitoring ecosystem, existing tools, and market opportunities.

**Key Contents**:
- Existing treasury monitoring solutions (MuesliSwap DAO, Clarity Protocol, Optim DAO Stack)
- Project Catalyst fund tracking tools and completion rates
- ADA wallet monitoring solutions (ADAM, TapTools)
- Current pain points and UTXO model limitations
- Market gaps and opportunities

**Key Insights**: Only ~50% of Catalyst funded projects reach completion, highlighting need for better monitoring.

### 02-API_PROVIDERS_AND_INTEGRATION.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide to Cardano blockchain API providers and production implementation strategies.

**Key Contents**:
- Ranked comparison of 7 API providers (NOWNodes, Bitquery, TangoCrypto, etc.)
- Detailed technical implementation for each provider
- Real high-value addresses for testing (Minswap DAO, Foundation addresses)
- Production-ready API endpoints and authentication methods
- Cost analysis and rate limits

**Recommended Stack**: 
- Primary: Koios API (open source, 5K req/day free)
- Secondary: NOWNodes (100K req/month free, immediate access)
- Fallback: Blockfrost (enterprise-grade, 50K req/day free)

### 03-ALERT_SYSTEMS_AND_THRESHOLDS.md
**Purpose**: Define alert thresholds and monitoring patterns for different organization sizes.

**Key Contents**:
- Alert patterns for small DAOs (<$50k), medium orgs ($50k-500k), large enterprises (>$500k)
- Urgency classifications and risk assessment criteria
- Compliance reporting requirements by jurisdiction
- Multi-signature wallet monitoring strategies
- Notification channel preferences by organization type

**Critical Thresholds**:
- Small DAOs: 10-15% of treasury in single transaction
- Medium Orgs: $25K ADA or 5% of treasury
- Enterprises: $100K ADA or 2% of treasury

### 04-PROJECT_CATALYST_INTEGRATION.md
**Purpose**: Technical guide for integrating with Project Catalyst treasury monitoring systems.

**Key Contents**:
- Official Catalyst data sources and APIs
- Milestone-based funding tracking mechanisms
- Catalyst Foundation Company (CFC) treasury addresses
- Address clustering and entity identification techniques
- Compliance and reporting automation strategies

**Key Resources**:
- Project Catalyst Platform: projectcatalyst.io
- Milestone Module automation system
- Public audit data availability

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Market Analysis** → Start with document 01 to understand the landscape
2. **API Selection** → Use document 02 to choose and implement blockchain data access
3. **Alert Configuration** → Apply document 03 thresholds based on client size
4. **Catalyst Integration** → Add specialized features from document 04 if needed
